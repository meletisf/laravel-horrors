# Laravel Horrors

I believe that most of us at some point in our lives were tasked with maintaining or updating a Laravel application that someone else wrote. Unlike other frameworks laravel is somewhat opinionated when it comes to what goes where. Thankfully the vast majority of things have a home somewhere in /app. Worst case scenario for beginners is that they have fat controllers. But is that the case?
